# Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
We give an overview of Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and describe the DKG protocol used in the paper {{#cite GJKR99}}. This, along with the ECVRF, will be two main components for the Distributed Verifiable Random Function (DVRF) protocol used for generating pseudorandom values. First, we give an overview of DKG. Then, we mention Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS), the main building block for a DKG protocol. Finally, we describe the DKG protocol of {{#cite GJKR99}}.
