## DKG Construction 
In this chapter, we describe the DKG protocol in the paper Gennaro et al {{#cite GJKR99}}. The protocol can withstand up to \\(\dfrac{n}{2}\\) dishonest participants, where \\(n\\) is the number of participants. Despite the high communication cost, the protocol only need to be used once in the first round of many threshold cryptosystems.
