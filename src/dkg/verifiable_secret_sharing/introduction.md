Distributed key generation is a main component of threshold cryptosystems. It allows \\(n\\) participants to take part and generate a pair of public key and secret key according to
the distribution defined by the underlying cryptosystem without having to rely on a trusted party (dealer). Each participant in additional receive a partial secret key and a partial public key. While the public key is output in the clear, the private key is maintained as a (virtual) \\(t,n\\) secret shared via a secret sharing scheme, where each share is the partial secret key of a participant {{#cite GJKR99}}. No adversary is able to learn anything about the secret key if it does not control the required amount of participants.


In this chapter, we discuss about Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS), the main building block for a DKG protocol. We state the syntax and security properties of a VSS, then describe the VSS construction due to Pedersen.
