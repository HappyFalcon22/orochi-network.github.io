### VRF in Blockchain

Many blockchains, namely [Algorand](https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-releases-first-open-source-code-of-verifiable-random-function-93c2960abd61), [Carnado](https://cardano-foundation.gitbook.io/stake-pool-course/lessons/introduction/ouroboros), [Polkadot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-randomness) use VRF to randomly select the next block proposer.

In 2020, [Chainlink](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-function-vrf/) use VRF as a secure source of on-chain randomness across the Web3 ecosystem, including in leading GameFi, DeFi, and NFT projects.

In 2021, [Harmony](https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/harmony-specifics/tools/harmony-vrf) use VRF  for their secure on-chain randomness.
