### Applications of Pizer Graphs 

Supersingular Isogeny Graph has applications in both mathematics and cryptography. We list several of their applications below.

1. **In mathematics** Supersingular Isogeny Graph is used in the following computational problems:

    1. The endomorphism ring computation problem: Given \\(p\\) and a
supersingular \\(j\\)-invariant \\(j\\), compute the endomorphism ring of \\(E(j)\\).
    1. The Deuring correspondence problem: Given a maximal order    
\\(\mathcal{O} \in B_{p,\inf}\\), return a supersingular j-invariant such that the endomorphism ring \\(E(j)\\) is isomorphic to \\(\mathcal{O}\\).

1. **In cryptography** Supersingular Isogeny Graph is used in encryption scheme {{#cite }}, signature scheme {{#cite}}, hash function {{#cite}}, verifiable delay function ((#cite )). These schemes are secure against the attack on SIKE.
