# Commitment to Polynomial Without Hiding Property
In the construction of {{#cite KZG10}}, the main idea to commit a polynomial is to evaluate it on a secret index. For example, assume that \\(f(X) = a_0 + a_1 X + \dots + a_d X^d \in \mathbb{F}[X]\\). The secret index can be thought of as some value \\(x\\) that the committer does not know. So, how can committer evaluate \\(f(x)\\) on that secret index without any knowledge about it? In fact, cryptography can magically help you do that. For instance, by putting \\(1, x, x^2, \dots, x^n \\) into the form of powers to some base element \\(g\\), e.g., \\(g^1, g^x, g^{x^2}, \dots, g^d\\), it helps to hide those values \\(1, x, x^2, \dots, x^d\\). Moreover, it alows you to evaluate \\(g^{f(x)}\\) as desired by computing
$$ (g^1)^{a_0} \cdot (g^x)^{a_1} \cdot (g^{x^2})^{a_2} \cdot \dots \cdot (g^{x^d})^{a_d} = g^{a_0 + a_1x + \dots a_d x^d} = g^{f(x)}.$$
Thus, \\(g^{f(x)}\\) is computed without any knowledge about \\(x\\). Hence, that is whatever the committer needs to do in the commit step, namely, executing the algorithm \\(\textsf{Commit}\\) to output the commitment \\(g^{f(x)}\\). So the commitment key \\(ck\\) for this algorithm is the hidden indices wrapped under powers of \\(g\\), namely, the set sequence \\((g^1, g^{x}, g^{x^2}, \dots, g^{x^d})\\). And, therefore, \\((g^1, g^{x}, g^{x^2}, \dots, g^{x^d})\\) is also the output of the algorithm \\(\textsf{Setup}\\). At this point, we might think about a few things:
1. How to verify the commitment \\(c = g^{f(x)}\\) by executing \\(\textsf{VerifyPoly}\\).
2. How to guarantee that the commitment satisfies the polynomial binding property.

For the first question, to verify \\(c\\), the decommitment of the construction is \\(f(X)\\) itself. Committer simply send the entire polynomial \\(f(X)\\) to verifier, namely, by sending coefficients \\(a_0, \dots, a_d\\). Having the polynomial and the commitment key \\(ck\\), the verifier can check easily by repeating steps similar to the algorithm \\(\textsf{Commit}\\). 

For the second question, to show the satisfaction of binding property, we can assume that the committer is able to break the binding property by introducing another polynomial \\(f'(X) = a'_0 + a'_1X + \dots + a'_dX^d\\) where \\(f'(X) \not= f(X)\\). So we have \\(g^{f(x)} = c = g^{f'(x)}\\).
