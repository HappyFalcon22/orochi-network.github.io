# KZG Polynomial Commitment Scheme
KZG polynomial commitment scheme {{#cite KZG10}} plays an important role in making the polynomial constraints of PlonK's arithmetization become a zkSNARK {{#cite GWC19}}.

In this section, we provide the syntax and security requirements of a polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) in [Syntax and Security Requirements of Polynomial Commitment Schemes](./pcs_definition.md). Then, we show specific constructions of the schemes by first discussing its technical overview in [Technical Overview](./technical_overview.md).
