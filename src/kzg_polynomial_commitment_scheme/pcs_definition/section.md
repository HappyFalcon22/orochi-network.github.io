# Polynomial Commitment Scheme - Definition
In this section, we provide the definition of polynomial commitment scheme including syntax and security requirements. Syntax describes how the scheme works through algorithms while security requirements enforce the scheme to satisfy in order to make it secure.

Syntax is presented in [Syntax](syntax.md) and security requirements are presented in [Security Requirements](security_requirement.md).
