# Dealing with Hiding
The previous sections, <span style="color:red"> to be written later</span>, we discussed the high level idea of the construction of algorithms as well as the polynomial and evaluation binding properties. One remaining thing is the hiding property. In {{#cite KZG10}}, the authors proposed \\(2\\) constructions from discrete logarithm assumption and Pedersen commitment.

The former, namely, discrete logarithm assumption, guarantees the hiding by its own hardness assumption. Therefore, the hiding here is conditional, i.e., against probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) adversaries. Here, PPT adversaries stand for the machines that attack the scheme with limited amount of time, and this amount of time is upper-bounded by a polynomial on input the security parameter given to the scheme.

The latter, namely, using Pedersen commitment, exploits the use of an additional part to achieve unconditional hiding property, which is secure against powerful adversaries and not limited to PPT ones. Roughly speaking, the external part can be informally thought of as a commitment to a random polynomial with conditional hiding. To perform this, we extend the commitment key \\(ck\\) to contain additional elements \\(h^1, h^x, \dots, h^{x^d}\\) where \\(h\\) is another generator different from \\(\mathbb{G}\\). Hence, the commitment key \\(ck\\) now is the tuple \\((g^1, \dots, g^{x^d}, h^1, \dots, h^{x^d})\\). Therefore, whenever committing to a polynomial \\(f(X) = a_0 + a_1X + \dots + a_dX^d\\), we additionally sample a polynomial \\(r(X) = r_0 + r_1X + \dots + r_dX^d\in \mathbb{F}[X]\\). The sampling process can be conducted easily by sampling each \\(r_i\\) uniformly and independently from \\(\mathbb{F}\\).<span style="color:red"> to be written later</span>
