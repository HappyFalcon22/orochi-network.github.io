# Discrete Logarithm Problem and Pairing
> **Remark.** There are \\(2\\) things we need to make clear here for anyone who is not familiar with cryptography, namely, cryptographic assumption and discrete logarithm assumption.
>
> In the context of this writing, we can assume that cryptographic assumption is some problem that is hard to solve by using our computation. It means that, to solve such a problem, the computer, or even some super computer or a large number of computers, needs to take a huge amount of time, possibly a few years to million of years, to find a solution for such problem.

> And, how about discrete logarithm problem? Well. To discuss this one, we need to understand something like *group theory*. But, as said previously, in the context of this writing, it is not required to know entire group theory. Instead, I will discuss some necessary things about the group required to use in this case. Specificially, it is cyclic group.<span style="color:red"> to be written later</span>
