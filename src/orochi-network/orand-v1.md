# Orand V1

Orand project was built based on Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (ECVRF). It is deterministic and verifiable based on assumptions from elliptic curves. Administrators of Orochi Network are unable to manipulate the results.

To optimize operation costs and improve security we provided following features:

- **Verifiable:** An Orand's epoch can be verified independently outside our system or can be verified by smart contracts.

- **Hybrid Proof System:** Our customers can choose between Fraud Proof or Validity Proof to feed the randomness.

- **Dual Proof:** An ECDSA proof will be combine with ECVRF proof to secure the feeding process, allow the feeding process to be done by any third party but the result still verifiable and immutable.

- **Batching:** We allowed you to set the batching limit for one epoch, e.g: We can batching 1000 randomness for one single epoch. The cost will be reduced significantly.

## Orand V2

Orand V2 will focus on utilizing Multi Party Computation (MPC) to secure the generating process, allow a whole system acting as one random oracle. It will make the process more dispersity, in this stage we boot up **Chaos Theory Alliance** to preventing predictability, everything is building up toward to the vision of **Decentralized Random Number Generator**. If you believed in the vision of **Decentralized Random Number Generator** email us ([contact@orochi.network](contact@orochi.network)) to participate in **Chaos Theory Alliance**.
