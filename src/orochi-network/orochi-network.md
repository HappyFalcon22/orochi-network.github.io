# Orochi Network: Building the Operating System for the Next Generation of Web

The internet is on the cusp of a major transformation, ushering in the era of Web3. This new iteration promises a decentralized web built on blockchain technology and cryptography, empowering users and fostering a more secure and transparent online experience. However, current Web3 applications (dApps) face limitations in terms of scalability, cost, and user experience. Orochi Network is stepping up to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive suite of products designed to be the foundation for a thriving Web3 ecosystem.
At the heart of Orochi Network lies zkOS, a cutting-edge zk-Operating System (zkOS). This system leverages the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to create a high-performance runtime fabric for zkApps (Zero-Knowledge Applications). ZKPs allow applications to prove the validity of information without revealing the underlying data itself. This innovation empowers zkApps to operate securely and efficiently without relying on centralized servers, a major bottleneck in current dApps. Developers can then focus on building innovative applications, leaving the complexities of computation and security to zkOS.

# More than the zkOS

Orochi Network offers a range of additional products that strengthen the Web3 infrastructure:

## Orocle (Decentralized Oracle Service)

This service acts as a bridge between dApps/zkApps and real-world data. It provides verifiable and secure access to real-time data across various blockchain networks, ensuring data integrity and fostering trust within the Web3 ecosystem.

## Orand (ECVRF-based randomness generation)

Many dApps, such as provably fair games and random number generators, rely on a secure and verifiable source of randomness. Orand utilizes Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (ECVRF) to generate cryptographically secure randomness that can be demonstrably fair, eliminating any doubts about manipulation.

## Orosign (MultiSig/MPC Wallet)

This user-centric mobile wallet prioritizes user control over digital assets and identities. By employing multi-signature/threshold-signature technology, Orosign empowers users with greater authority over their digital lives within the Web3 space.

## zkDatabase (Provable Database)

A noSQL database specifically designed for the Web3 space. This database integrates Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, allowing users to store and manage data in a distributed DAG while keeping the data confidential. zkDatabase leverages the advantages of noSQL databases for scalability and flexibility, along with ZKPs to ensure data privacy and verifiability within the Web3 ecosystem.

## zkMemory (Memory Prover)

This component functions as a generic ZK module, providing the building blocks for developers to construct any type of zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine). zkMemory empowers developers with the flexibility to create custom virtual machines tailored to specific needs within the Web3 landscape.

## Orochimaru (Full-node client)

Built upon the robust Substrate Framework, Orochimaru plays a critical role in ensuring network security and functionality. It achieves this by validating transactions, securing the network through participation in Orochi Consensus, an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus mechanism. This advanced consensus protocol allows Orochimaru nodes to reach agreement on the state of the network even in the presence of potentially faulty nodes, regardless of any delays or message losses. In essence, Orochimaru acts as the backbone of Orochi Network, safeguarding its integrity and enabling smooth operation even under challenging conditions.

## Shaping Web3 Future

In essence, Orochi Network's suite of products, anchored by the innovative zkOS, lays the groundwork for a future web built on secure, scalable, and user-friendly blockchain applications. By addressing the limitations of current dApps, Orochi Network has the potential to unlock the true potential of Web3, paving the way for a more decentralized and empowering online experience for everyone.

The promise of Orochi Network has been recognized by leading organizations within the blockchain space. Orochi Network is a grantee of the **Ethereum Foundation**, **Web3 Foundation**, **Mina Protocol**, and **Aleo**. This recognition underscores the potential of Orochi Network's technology to shape the future of Web3.
