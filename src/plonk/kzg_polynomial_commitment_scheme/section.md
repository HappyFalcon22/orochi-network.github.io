## KZG Polynomial Commitment Scheme
KZG polynomial commitment scheme {{#cite KZG10}} plays an important role in making the polynomial constraints of PlonK's arithmetization become a zkSNARK.

In this section, we provide the syntax and security requirement of polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) in <span style="color:red">Add text here</span>. Then, we discuss KZK {{#cite KZG10}}, a realization of PCS in <span style="color:red">Add text here</span>.
