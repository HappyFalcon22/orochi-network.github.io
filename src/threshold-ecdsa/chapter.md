# Threshold Signature

In this chapter, we give an overview of threshold signatures and describe the construction of Gennaro et al in {{#cite GG20}}. The chapter is separated into \\(3\\) major parts. In the first part, we give a brief introduction to threshold signatures and state its syntax and security properties. In the second part, we describe the threshold ecdsa construction of {{#cite GG20}}. Finally, we briefly specify our implementation briefly and security concern of the implementation.
