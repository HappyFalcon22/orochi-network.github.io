# Threshold Signature

In this chapter, we give an overview of threshold signatures and describe the construction of Gennaro et al in {{#cite GG20}}. The chapter is separated into \\(3\\) major parts. First, we give a brief introduction to threshold signatures and state its syntax and security properties in [Introduction](./threshold-ecdsa-introduction/introduction.md). We then describe the threshold ecdsa construction of {{#cite GG20}} in [Gennaro's Construction](./threshold-ecdsa-construction/introduction.md). Finally, we briefly specify our implementation briefly and security concern of the implementation in [Implementation Specification](./intended-implementation/our-intended-implementation.md).
