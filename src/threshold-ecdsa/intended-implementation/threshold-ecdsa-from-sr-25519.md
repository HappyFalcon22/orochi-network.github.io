### Threshold ECDSA from Sr25519

- **sr25519:** This curve is implemented in the [Schnorrkel](https://github.com/w3f/schnorrkel) library to support Schnorr sinature. Technically, the curve can also be used in threshold ECDSA, hence we intend to support the choice of sr25519 in our implementation version.
