### Analysis

In this section, we provide the complexity analysis of the protocol.

**Key Generation:**

**Signing:**

**Verification:** To verify the validity of a signature, an external verifier just has to perform the standard ECDSA verify algorithm, which incurs \\(\mathcal{O}(1)\\) verification cost.
