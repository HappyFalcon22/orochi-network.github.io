# zkDatabase

In this document, we delve into various components and aspects of zkDatabase. We explore its functionalities and underlying constructions to offer a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism and operation.


In this section, we delve into accumulation. We'll discuss how the Mina Blockchain processes a multitude of transactions simultaneously. It’s a quick and secure system ensuring every transaction is verified efficiently. [Accumulation](./accumulation/accumulation.md). In this portion, we demystify B-Trees. Learn how they assist in organizing vast information on the Mina Blockchain, facilitating easy management and effective utilization. Grasp the workings of these trees in maintaining order and efficiency within the blockchain. [B-Tree](./b-tree/b-tree.md). Here we explore composability, where we understand how various elements within the Mina Blockchain seamlessly interlink. It’s like observing a well-coordinated mechanism, each part complementing the other, ensuring smooth operations throughout. [Composability](./composability/composability.md). Serialization in the context of SnakyJS refers to the conversion of specific data types used within the SnakyJS framework to BSON (Binary JSON) and vice versa. This process allows for the efficient storage and transmission of data, retaining the structure and type information necessary for seamless and accurate data processing within the SnakyJS environment. [Serialization](./serialization/serialization.md). Data-collection from blockchain involves the extraction and processing of information stored on a blockchain network. This process enables the retrieval of transaction details, contract interactions, and other relevant data from the decentralized and distributed ledgers of blockchain networks, ensuring analysis, auditing, and transparency of blockchain activities. [Data Collection](./data-collection/data-collection.md). In this part, focus shifts to the distributed storage engine. Understand how we utilize IPFS to securely and efficiently store data across. It's a robust system ensuring data integrity and easy accessibility. [Distributed Storage Engine](./distributed-storage-engine/section.md). Finally, we dive into Merkle Trees. Discover how we use this special tool to uphold the accuracy and integrity of all transactions and data, ensuring they remain tamper-proof. [Merkle Tree](./merkle-tree/merkle-tree.md).
